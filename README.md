# Explore .NET and C# Concepts

There's more to a programming language than the syntax of the code. Different languages approach programming in very different ways. For example, Javascript allows you to change the data type of a variable, while C# does not.

Let's explore some of the _conceptual_ and semantic differences between Javascript and C# & .Net. Join up into pairs and research one of the following questions. You will be teaching these back to the class!

## C# Questions
- Is this language _compiled_ or _interpreted_? What's the difference?
- Does this language use dynamic or static typing? What's the difference?
- What are all the different data types that are available in this language? What is a "generic" data type?
- What package manager is used to install libraries? What are some popular libraries?
- What is object oriented programming (OOP)? What are the benefits of OOP?
- What is a constructor function?
- What does the keyword `public` mean in the phrase `public static void`? What other keywords could be used here, and how would they behave differently?
- What does the keyword `static` mean in the phrase `public static void`? What other keywords could be used here, and how would they behave differently?
- What does the keyword `void` mean in the phrase `public static void`? What other keywords could be used here, and how would they behave differently?
- What is an _interface_? What's the difference between an `abstract` and a `virtual` method?
- What are getters and setters?
- What is a namespace? What are the benefits of using namespaces?
- What is `overloading`? 
- What is `boxing` and `unboxing`?
- What does `value type` or `reference type` mean?
- Whats an Attribute?
 
## .Net Questions
- What's the difference between .NET and C#?
- What is MVC?
- What can you build with .NET?
- What is a SDK vs a Runtime?
- What can you make with the `dotnet` command?


## Stretch Questions (If you want one of these, you have to also present something above!)

- What are Singleton Design Patterns? (`singletons`)
- What is Garbage Collection?
- What changed with Dotnet 5? 6?
- What are the pillars of OOP? Summarize them.

- More?


Take notes, and be prepared to **share your findings to the class** when you're done.
